# Efficient task planning adaptation under uncertainty

## Abstract

A hybrid approach that effectively solves the task planning problem by decomposing it into two intertwined parts, starting with the identification of a feasible plan and followed by its uncertainty augmentation and verification yielding a set of Pareto optimal plans. To enhance its robustness, adaptation tactics are devised for the evolving system requirements and agentâ€™s capabilities. We demonstrate our approach through an industrial case study involving workers and robots undertaking activities within a vineyard, showcasing the benefits of our hybrid approach both in the generation of feasible solutions and scalability compared to native planners.

## Running the hybrid planning

Follow the steps to run the hybrid task planner from the terminal! 

1) First, create a python environment:
```
cd src
python3 -m venv prj-venv
```
(or python)

```
source prj-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(or pip3)

2) Download [EvoChecker](https://github.com/gerasimou/EvoChecker/tree/evoCheckerJar) inside [src/apps](https://github.com/Gricel-lee/EfficientPlanAdaptation/tree/main/src/apps). The new folder must contain the following files:

3) Modify ```run.sh``` file with your installation paths.


4) Run the hybrid planner in the terminal as:
```
./run.sh
```
This should create a folder with the name of each of your .json files, with:
- Data from numerical planner: PDDL files, plan, EvoChecker files, execution times per run
- Data from uncertainty augmentation: Pareto front and set obtained per run, execution times per run

**Enjoy!**

## Specify a new planning problem

Planning problems are specified using JSON files located in the INPUT_DIR path, as defined in run.sh. These JSON files contain the full description of the task, including agents, locations, paths, and mission constraints. To create a new planning problem, follow the structure of the example file:```src/Problems/Agricultural/agricultural.json```:
Guidelines for Creating JSON Planning Files:
- Do not use underscores (_) in any ID names.
- All IDs must be unique.
- Probabilities must be specified as floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, with at least one decimal place.
- Task instance IDs must follow the pattern: taskID + locationID + uniqueCharacter (e.g., t2l5a where t2 is the task, l5 is the location, and a differentiates the instance).



## Full-MDP
To create a full-MDP PRISM file from a JSON file, go to:
```src/aux/fullMDP```


## Git commit note (for devs)
To submit changes, avoid large files by:
```
git add .
git reset src/prj-venv src/apps/EvoChecker/
git commit -m "."
git push
```

If requires hard reset, make copy of folder, then go back n commits, e.g., 1 commit behind:
```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
Go back to the last commit that was able to push
