# Efficient task planning adaptation under uncertainty

## Abstract

A hybrid approach that effectively solves the task planning problem by decomposing it into two intertwined parts, starting with the identification of a feasible plan and followed by its uncertainty augmentation and verification yielding a set of Pareto optimal plans. To enhance its robustness, adaptation tactics are devised for the evolving system requirements and agentâ€™s capabilities. We demonstrate our approach through an industrial case study involving workers and robots undertaking activities within a vineyard, showcasing the benefits of our hybrid approach both in the generation of feasible solutions and scalability compared to native planners.

## Running hybrid planner

1) Download [EvoChecker](https://github.com/gerasimou/EvoChecker/tree/evoCheckerJar) inside [src/apps](https://github.com/Gricel-lee/EfficientPlanAdaptation/tree/main/src/apps). The new folder must contain the following files:

2) Modify ```run.sh``` and ```config.ini``` file with your installation paths.

3) Run the hybrid planner in the terminal as
```
./run.sh
```
This will automatically activate the Python environment, FastAPI, and the web app.

4) After running this script, the API and **web app** will be running locally at **```http://localhost:8001```** (port defined in run.sh).

Note: To test and submit a planning problem directly throught the API try ```http://localhost:8001/docs``` instead. For documentation on how FastAPI works, go to [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#interactive-api-docs).


The web app allows you to submit planning problems (a description and the path to the JSON path with the planning problem).

Check the Pareto front results when a planning problem is completed.

Check failure messages:

And delete planning problem:

Note: When a new planning problem is added, the Hybrid planner is started under-the-hood using our API. For example, the status of all jobs are avaialble at ```http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/problems/```.
 At completion, the hybrid planner should create a folder in the input .JSON file directory, with the generated data:
- Data from numerical planner: PDDL files, plan, EvoChecker files, execution times per run
- Data from uncertainty augmentation: Pareto front and set obtained per run, execution times per run


**Enjoy!**


## Full-MDP
To create a full-MDP PRISM file from a JSON file, go to:
```src/aux/fullMDP```


## Git commit note (for devs)
To submit changes, avoid large files by:
```
git add .
git reset src/prj-venv src/apps/EvoChecker/
git commit -m "."
git push
```

If requires hard reset, make copy of folder, then go back n commits, e.g., 1 commit behind:
```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
Go back to the last commit that was able to push
