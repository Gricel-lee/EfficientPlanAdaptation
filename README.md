# Efficient task planning adaptation under uncertainty

## Abstract

A hybrid approach that effectively solves the task planning problem by decomposing it into two intertwined parts, starting with the identification of a feasible plan and followed by its uncertainty augmentation and verification yielding a set of Pareto optimal plans. To enhance its robustness, adaptation tactics are devised for the evolving system requirements and agentâ€™s capabilities. We demonstrate our approach through an industrial case study involving workers and robots undertaking activities within a vineyard, showcasing the benefits of our hybrid approach both in the generation of feasible solutions and scalability compared to native planners.

## Running hybrid planner

1) Download [EvoChecker](https://github.com/gerasimou/EvoChecker/tree/evoCheckerJar) inside [src/apps](https://github.com/Gricel-lee/EfficientPlanAdaptation/tree/main/src/apps). The new folder must contain the following files:

2) Modify ```run.sh``` and ```config.ini``` file with your installation paths.

3) Run the hybrid planner in the terminal as:
```
./run.sh
```
4) After running this script, the FastAPI server will be running.

For documentation and to check how it works, go to http://localhost:8001/docs

Here, you can interact with the server to submit a planning problem (for more documentation visit [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#interactive-api-docs) )
For example, in @post/problems/Add Problem, set a submit a new planning problem by providing the Json file and a description of the problem.

After executing this, the Hybrid planner is started under-the-hood. See the status and all jobs in @post/problems/Get All Planning Problems
 At completion, it should create a folder in the .json file folder, with:
- Data from numerical planner: PDDL files, plan, EvoChecker files, execution times per run
- Data from uncertainty augmentation: Pareto front and set obtained per run, execution times per run

**Enjoy!**


## Full-MDP
To create a full-MDP PRISM file from a JSON file, go to:
```src/aux/fullMDP```


## Git commit note (for devs)
To submit changes, avoid large files by:
```
git add .
git reset src/prj-venv src/apps/EvoChecker/
git commit -m "."
git push
```

If requires hard reset, make copy of folder, then go back n commits, e.g., 1 commit behind:
```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
Go back to the last commit that was able to push
